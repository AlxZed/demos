## Overview

The MLRun demos are end-to-end use-case applications that leverage [MLRun](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun) to implement complete machine-learning (ML) pipelines &mdash; including data collection and preparation, model training, and deployment automation.

The demos demonstrate how you can

- Run ML pipelines locally from a web notebook such as Jupyter Notebook.
- Run some or all tasks on an elastic Kubernetes cluster by using serverless functions.

The demo applications are tested on the [Iguazio Data Science Platform](https://www.iguazio.com/) ("the platform") and use its shared data fabric, which is accessible via the `v3io` file-system mount; if you're not already a platform user, [request a free trial](https://www.iguazio.com/lp/14-day-free-trial-in-the-cloud/).

### General ML Workflow

The provided demos implement some or all of the ML workflow steps illustrated in the following image:

<a id="prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites

To run the MLRun demos, first do the following:

- Prepare a Kubernetes cluster with preinstalled operators or custom resources (CRDs) for Horovod and/or Nuclio, depending on the demos that you wish to run.
- Install an MLRun service on your cluster.
  See the instructions in the [MLRun documentation](https://docs.mlrun.org/en/latest/install.html).
- Ensure that your cluster has a shared file or object storage for storing the data (artifacts).

## Getting-started Tutorial

[**The tutorial**](./getting-started-tutorial/01-mlrun-basics.ipynb) covers MLRun fundamentals such as creation of projects and data ingestion and preparation, and demonstrates how to create an end-to-end machine-learning (ML) pipeline.
MLRun is integrated as a default (pre-deployed) shared service in the Iguazio Data Science Platform.

You'll learn how to

- Collect (ingest), prepare, and analyze data
- Train, deploy, and monitor an ML model
- Create and run an automated ML pipeline

You'll also learn about the basic concepts, components, and APIs that allow you to perform these tasks, including

- Setting up MLRun
- Creating and working with projects
- Creating, deploying and running MLRun functions
- Using MLRun to run functions, jobs, and full workflows
- Deploying a model to a serving layer using serverless functions

## scikit-learn Demo: Full AutoML Pipeline

The [**scikit-learn-pipeline**](./scikit-learn-pipeline/README.md) demo demonstrates how to build a full end-to-end automated-ML (AutoML) pipeline using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) and the UCI [Iris data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

The combined CI/data/ML pipeline includes the following steps:

- Create an Iris data-set generator (ingestion) function.
- Ingest the Iris data set.
- Analyze the data-set features.
- Train and test the model using multiple algorithms (AutoML).
- Deploy the model as a real-time serverless function.
- Test the serverless function's REST API with a test data set.

To run the demo, download the [**sklearn-project.ipynb**](./scikit-learn-pipeline/sklearn-project.ipynb) notebook into an empty directory and run the code cells according to the instructions in the notebook.

## How-To: Converting Existing ML Code to an MLRun Project

The [**converting-to-mlrun**](./converting-to-mlrun/README.md) how-to demo demonstrates how to convert existing ML code to an MLRun project.
The demo implements an MLRun project for taxi ride-fare prediction based on a [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/jsylas/python-version-of-top-ten-rank-r-22-m-2-88) with an ML Python script that uses data from the [New York City Taxi Fare Prediction competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction).

The code includes the following components:

1. Data ingestion
2. Data cleaning and preparation
3. Model training
4. Model serving

## Model deployment Pipeline: Real-time operational Pipeline

This demo shows how to deploy a model with streaming information.

This demo is comprised of several steps:

<p><img src="./model-deployment-pipeline/assets/model-deployment-pipeline.png" alt="Model deployment Pipeline Real-time operational Pipeline" width="500"/></p>

> **Note**: this demo uses the Iguazio multi-model data layer (V3IO), primarily for real-time streaming. To run this demo outside
> an Iguazio cluster, you will need to get credentials to access a V3IO system.

While this demo covers the use case of 1<sup>st</sup>-day churn, it is easy to replace the data, related features and training model and reuse the same workflow for different business cases.

These steps are covered by the following pipeline:

- **1. Data generator** â€” Generates events for the training and serving and Create an enrichment table (lookup values). 
- **2. Event handler** - Receive data from the input. This is a common input stream for all the data. This way, one can easily replace the event source data (in this case we have a data generator) without affecting the rest of this flow. It also store all incoming data to parquet files.
- **3. Stream to features** - Enrich the stream using the enrichment table and Update aggregation features using the incoming event handler.
- **4. Optional model training steps -**
 - **4.1 Get Data Snapshot** - Takes a snapshot of the feature table for training.
  - **4.2 Describe the Dataset** - Runs common analysis on the datasets and produces plots suche as histogram, feature importance, corollation and more.
  - **4.3 Training** - Runing training with multiple classification models.
  - **4.4 Testing** - Testing the best performing model.
- **5. Serving** - Serve the model and process the data from the enriched stream and aggregation features.
- **6. Inference logger** - We use the same event handler function from above but only its capability to store incoming data to parquet files.

## Stock-Analysis Demo

This demo tackles a common requirement of running a data-engineering pipeline as part of ML model serving by reading data from external data sources and generating insights using ML models.
The demo reads stock data from an external source, analyzes the related market news, and visualizes the analyzed data in a Grafana dashboard.

> **Note**: this demo uses the Iguazio multi-model data layer (V3IO), primarily for real-time streaming. To run this demo outside
> an Iguazio cluster, you will need to get credentials to access a V3IO system.

The demo demonstrates how to

- Train a sentiment-analysis model using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers ([BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert)) natural language processing (NLP) technique, and deploy the model.
- Deploy Python code to a scalable function using [Nuclio](https://nuclio.io/).
- Integrate with the real-time multi-model data layer of the Iguazio Data Science Platform ("the platform") &mdash; time-series databases (TSDB) and NoSQL (key-value) storage.
- Leverage machine learning to generate insights.
- Process streaming data and visualize it on a user-friendly dashboard.

The demo include the following steps:

1.  **Training and validating the model** (BERT Model); can be skipped by downloading a pre-trained model (default).
2.  **Deploying a sentiment-analysis model server**.
3.  **Ingesting stock data**.
4.  **Scraping stock news and analyzing sentiments** to generate sentiment predictions.
5.  **Deploying a stream viewer** that reads data from the stocks news and sentiments stream and can be used as a Grafana data source.
6.  **Visualizing the data on a Grafana dashboard**, using the stream viewer as a data source.
